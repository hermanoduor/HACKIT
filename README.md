#What is HACKIT?
HACKIT is the annual Scholastic International School hackathon. It's our premier student-led event, run by students for students. Everyone from year 6 and above who is interested in tech and STEAM is welcome to participate! HACKIT offers an opportunity for students of all levels to get involved and challenge themselves to build an awesome product to solve a problem. No prior knowledge of any particular programming language is required.
 
Please note: students who attend are expected to attend all day for both days. This ensures all teams have fair and equal numbers of members contributing to the team effort.
 
How Does HACKIT Work?
Students can network with like-minded peers and have fun building friendships and exciting, creative products. Each participating school will assign students into pairs. At the event, each pair will be assigned to another pair, most likely students from another school. So, they can create new friendships and collaborate with different people. If there is an odd number of participants, each school can have one group of three.
 
A set of scenarios based on the theme will be revealed during the opening ceremony. This year, the theme is Smart Transport. As a team, students will pick a scenario and work on solving it through technology. Their prototype can involve software, hardware or even a mix of both!!
 
Incorporated into the event are a series of workshops, details of which will be up on our website soon. Students select two workshops they would like to attend on Saturday morning â€“ they can then put their newfound knowledge and skills to good use during the rest of the event!
 
Students can present their products on the last day of HACKIT in a science-fair-style presentation. The judges will assess the product and ask the team questions about their development process. The top groups will present their products to everyone, and the winners will be announced.
 
What equipment do students need to bring?
A laptop and charger, pocket money, plus a handful of creativity, and you are ready to go! Feel free to bring any additional equipment you need. We will also provide various equipment, including microbits, Arduino board and printers.
